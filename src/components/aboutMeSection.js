                Hi, I'm Bennett! I am a recent UCSB graduate, currently continuing my work at the UCSB “Big Bee” Lab. At the lab, I’ve built a multimodal entomology chatbot by indexing their massive database of text, image, and tabular data. At the UCSB Alumni Association, I automated hundreds of hours of manual data processing, enabling time for more strategic initiatives. I also built and deployed a full-stack, AI-assisted document sharing app called Brainsink. Before then, I got my start in 2022 helping Amotions AI migrate their no-code platform to a modern web stack and secure their first client.
                </p>

                {/*I'm recently completed my degrees in Statistics and Data Science & Philosophy, as well as a certificate in Technology Management. My academic work ranged from Thomas Bayes to Reneé Descartes, and I am fortunate enough to find it all (varying degrees of) interesting. I find the most interest in Web Development, Machine Learning, and Metaphysics. Thanks for checking out my portfolio, enjoy! */}
                Apart from studying SWE, ML, and AI, I do other cool stuff, too! I'm a proud Eagle Scout. I’ve played Trombone at the Monterey Jazz Festival and played Euphonium at Carnegie Hall! I played D1 Rugby at UCSB, and last year my grandpa and I flew a single engine plane down to Mexico! I enjoy fishing, basketball, and piano. Thanks for checking out my portfolio!
